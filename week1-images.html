				not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, 
				or where the doer of deeds od deeds could have done them better.
				The credits belongs to the man <span style="margin-left : 35px">who</span> is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood;
				who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming;
				but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasm, the great devotion; who spends himself in a worthy cause;
				who at the best knows in the triumph of hogh achioevement, and who at worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly,
				so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid, souls who neither know victory&nbsp;nor&nbsp;defeat.&quot;
